C# GroovesharkAPI and Player
Alpha only with Contracts without any Tests... Expect nothing!

Grooveshark often updates revTokens for their different clients.
Then you need to decompile the JSQueue SWF and you need to look at the JavaScript source to get the new tokens.

Example:

    Client.Instance.Connect();
	string songID = Client.Instance.Search<SearchSong>("eminem")[0].SongID;
	AudioStreamInfo information = Client.Instance.GetAudioStreamInformation(songID);
	Stream audioStream = Client.Instance.GetAudioStream(information);
